### Assignment
In class you will meet with other students to share and discuss your proposals.
Outside of class you will fork and clone the repo of your paired-programming
companion and try to execute a minimal working example of their code, and 
to understand how it works under the hood.

### Exploring their code
Your goal is to gain a better understanding of their code. 
If you see a place in their code that is poorly formatted (e.g., your 
linter has highlighted it), then fix it. Commit the change and in the 
comment field state why you re-formatted it. If you are unsure why a 
certain part of code exists then stick a print statement inside of the code 
block to print the state of variables to better understand, and if you are still
unsure, add a comment to the developer letting them know that this part of their
code is hard to understand, and should be better commented. 

Your goal is to make a commit to your fork of their project and then make a
pull request for them to examine it.
