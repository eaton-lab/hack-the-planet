##

### Prerequisites

Let's make sure we have necessary modules installed, including `matplotlib` and `scikit-learn`,
which we will briefly introduce, but will get into more detail on next week.

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge matplotlib scikit-learn
```

Open a new notebook and include a few imports that we will need in a new cell:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
```

### Fetch the Iris data

We have been loading and cleaning the iris data by hand up to this point, but now
we are going to make use of a nice feature in scikit-learn, which provides the iris
data as a pre-loaded dataset. This chunk of code is 'data curation': we load in
the iris data, transform it into a pandas DataFrame (it is not structured natively as
a dataframe because it a bunch of other features internally), and then create a new
column called `species` to hold the species IDs.

```python
iris = load_iris()
iris_df = pd.DataFrame(data=iris.data, columns=iris.feature_names)
iris_df['species'] = pd.Categorical.from_codes(iris.target, iris.target_names)
iris_df
```
## Exploring the data 1-D at a time with histograms

Let's say we want to visualize the differences between the different measurements for each
of the species. A simple way to do this is with histograms. Here we will use the `pd.groupby`
method to group the data by species ID.

```python
feature = "sepal length (cm)"
gb = iris_df.groupby("species")
for sp, dat in gb:
    plt.hist(dat[feature], label=sp)
```

### Set the alpha channel

```python
feature = "sepal length (cm)"
gb = iris_df.groupby("species")
for sp, dat in gb:
    plt.hist(dat[feature], label=sp, alpha=0.01)
plt.legend()
```

### Change the colors

You can specify colors in several different ways, but the most straightforward way is to pick
from the large list of [matplotlib named colors](https://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/color/named_colors.html).
Here are some examples:

```python
feature = "sepal length (cm)"
gb = iris_df.groupby("species")
cdict = {'setosa':'cornflowerblue',
         'versicolor':'salmon',
         'virginica':'goldenrod'}
for sp, dat in gb:
    plt.hist(dat[feature], label=sp, alpha=0.5, color=cdict[sp])
```

### Add a legend
```python
feature = "sepal length (cm)"
gb = iris_df.groupby("species")
cdict = {'setosa':'cornflowerblue',
         'versicolor':'salmon',
         'virginica':'goldenrod'}
for sp, dat in gb:
    plt.hist(dat[feature], label=sp, alpha=0.5, color=cdict[sp])
plt.legend()
```

### Add axis labels and title
```python
feature = "sepal length (cm)"
gb = iris_df.groupby("species")
cdict = {'setosa':'cornflowerblue',
         'versicolor':'salmon',
         'virginica':'goldenrod'}
for sp, dat in gb:
    plt.hist(dat[feature], label=sp, alpha=0.5, color=cdict[sp])

plt.title(f'Histogram of {feature} by Species')
plt.ylabel('Count')
plt.xlabel(feature)
```

### Saving figures to a file

Once you are happy with your figure, you can either right-click on the image in the
notebook and "copy output to clipboard", but this will copy a low-res version of the image, which is fine for presentations but not great for publications. For this reason
matplotlib provides a [`savefig()`](https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.savefig.html) method for saving the resulting figure in several
different possible output formats, also allowing to control the output resolution (using
the `dpi` argument, for example). Here is an example of saving as a standard resolution PNG file.

```python
feature = "sepal length (cm)"
gb = iris_df.groupby("species")
cdict = {'setosa':'cornflowerblue',
         'versicolor':'salmon',
         'virginica':'goldenrod'}
for sp, dat in gb:
    plt.hist(dat[feature], label=sp, alpha=0.5, color=cdict[sp])

plt.title(f'Histogram of {feature} by Species')
plt.ylabel('Count')
plt.xlabel(feature)
plt.savefig('sepal_length.png')
```
After you call this code you should see a new file called "sepal_length.png" in your
jupyter lab browser, and you can even double-click it to open it in jupter lab to
verify that it looks good.

You can see what other file formats are available by calling the 
`get_supported_filetypes()` function, like this:
```python
plt.gcf().canvas.get_supported_filetypes()
```
```
{'eps': 'Encapsulated Postscript',
 'jpg': 'Joint Photographic Experts Group',
 'jpeg': 'Joint Photographic Experts Group',
 'pdf': 'Portable Document Format',
 'pgf': 'PGF code for LaTeX',
 'png': 'Portable Network Graphics',
 'ps': 'Postscript',
 'raw': 'Raw RGBA bitmap',
 'rgba': 'Raw RGBA bitmap',
 'svg': 'Scalable Vector Graphics',
 'svgz': 'Scalable Vector Graphics',
 'tif': 'Tagged Image File Format',
 'tiff': 'Tagged Image File Format',
 'webp': 'WebP Image Format'}
 ```

### Post a copy of your finished histogram
I have created a google slides presentation for [sharing our data visualizations](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1igz4QA3xjwvljIhG_CFXE9zYC9bSz3nfS2LXNzi0OCk/edit#slide=id.p). Open this link (you will need to use your CU account), and paste your favorite visualization into a new slide.

### Challenge: Visualize another column of data
Now that you have the code settled for one column of the data,
and you *abstracted* out the feature to plot as a variable named `feature`, it should be simple to plot another feature by dropping in another variable name. Go ahead and try it.

## Visualizing 2-D data with scatterplots

Often we will have more than one dimension of data and we might have hypotheses
about how the different dimension of data co-vary in our dataset. Let's remind ourselves of what types of data we have available in the iris data.

```python
print(iris_df.columns)
```
```
Index(['sepal length (cm)', 'sepal width (cm)', 'petal length (cm)',
       'petal width (cm)', 'species'],
      dtype='object')
```

Let's choose sepal length and width, as these seem like they might be reasonably
correlated. The machinery of plotting 2D data is pretty similar to plotting the 1D data
with the exception that we need to provide x and y values for each datapoint. Whereas
above with `hist` we only passed in one column of data, now we need to pass in two columns,
otherwise the details of manipulating the 'look' of the figure are quite similar.

```python
gb = iris_df.groupby("species")
x_feature = "sepal length (cm)"
y_feature = "sepal width (cm)"
for sp, dat in gb:
    plt.scatter(dat[x_feature], dat[y_feature], label=sp)
plt.legend()
```

### Styling scatterplots

```python
x_feature = "sepal length (cm)"
y_feature = "sepal width (cm)"

gb = iris_df.groupby("species")
cdict = {'setosa':'cornflowerblue',
         'versicolor':'salmon',
         'virginica':'goldenrod'}
for sp, dat in gb:
    plt.scatter(dat[x_feature], dat[y_feature], label=sp, alpha=0.75, color=cdict[sp])

plt.title(f'Histogram of {feature} by Species')
plt.ylabel('Count')
plt.xlabel(feature)
plt.legend()
plt.savefig('sepal_length.png')
```

One difference with `scatter` is that you can define a "marker style", which controls
the form of the scatter points. You can define the marker for a scatterplot using the 
`marker` argument, for example `marker="*"` would use stars instead of points. There are
many [options for marker style that you can see in the documentation](https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/markers_api.html)

### Scatterplot challenge

In fact you can reasonably represent 3-Dimensions in a scatterplot by using the size of the marker
to indicate a third dimension. This is something that was shown in the reading this week
in [section 04.02](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/04.02-simple-scatter-plots.html).
If you have time, experiment with seeing if you can recreate this figure.

### Post a copy of your finished scatterplot
As before, post your finished scatterplot to our doc for [sharing our data visualizations](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1igz4QA3xjwvljIhG_CFXE9zYC9bSz3nfS2LXNzi0OCk/edit#slide=id.p). Go ahead
and post it on the same slide as your histogram, side by side.

## Further challenges if time remains

Use the `requests` module to download a [small mammal life history dataset](https://esapubs.org/archive/ecol/E084/093/Mammal_lifehistories_v2.txt) that was published by Ernst in 2003 in the Journal Ecology.

Load this data into a pandas DataFrame. You will need to use a couple additional arguments when
reading this file, which indicate tab separated values and replace missing data values with NaN. 
Here is the call you'll need to load the data:
`pd.read_csv("Mammal_lifehistories_v2.txt", sep="\t", na_values=['-999', '-999.00'])`

* Use a scatter plot to investigate adult mass vs. newborn mass. What do you notice about this
plot?
* Try transforming the data using `np.log10()` and then replotting the same data
* For data where order is Rodentia, graph the log (base 10) of adult mass vs. the log (base 10) of newborn mass.
