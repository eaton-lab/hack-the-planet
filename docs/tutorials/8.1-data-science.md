## Python Data Science

### Numpy and Pandas
The `numpy` and `pandas` libraries are the core of data science in Python.
The numpy `ndarray` and pandas `DataFrame` class objects are custom classes
that can be used to store, visualize, and operate on structured data. 
Here we will explore how you can use these custom classes within your own
code to leverage the power of these modules to improve efficiency and add
power and flexibility.


### Recap
The past few sessions you have been developing a micro-project in the `wf.ipynb`
notebook. The goal of this was to create simple functions to implement
the Wright-Fisher process of genetic drift, and then to wrap these functions
in a class. At the end of the in-class exercise we saw a bit about performance
evaluation, and how small changes can have big effects on runtime. Here


### Numpy Challenge: Add data science to your micro-project
Your challenge today is to return to your program and re-implement the 
internal data structures and code to use numpy arrays and vectorized
functions, instead of python native lists and standard library functions.
You will then do some performance evaluation to see how large a difference
this makes.

To complete this assignment you will need to do the following:

- Add a new parameter to your `__init__` method called `with_np` and
set the default to False. Store this value as a class attribute.
- Add a new conditional branch inside `__init__` to test for this
flag, and if True you will implement the `self.pop` attribute
using numpy arrays.
- Modify your `step()` method to test the `with_np` attribute, and
if True use numpy vectorized functions to replace `random.choice()`.
- In a new cell and instantiate two new objects of type `Population`,
one called `pop` and the other `pop_np`, set the population size to
100 and set the `with_np` flag appropriately given the name of these
objects.
- Now you will create two new cells to use `%%timeit` to test the
performance of each of these. In each cell you will have one call
to `step()` initially setting `ngens=1000`, with one cell for `pop`
and the other for `pop_np`.
- Evaluate the performance of the numpy code across a range of
population sizes and numbers of generations. In a new cell use markdown
to record and document your findings. What did you find and what do
you conclude from this?
