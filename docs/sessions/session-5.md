## Icebreaker question
* What is your lucky number (if you are at liberty to divulge it)?
```python
# Define the icebreaker procedure
for student in class:
    response = icebreaker_question()
    if response.isfunny():
        self.laugh()
    elif response.isinteresting():
        self.stroke_chin_thoughfully()
    else:
        self.thumbs_up()
```

## :material-book-variant: Learning objectives
In this session we will learn about the the fundamental elements of the python

session you will be more familiar with the following topics:

- How to assign variables of different data types and perform basic manipulations
- Creating lists and using slicing and indexing
- Control flow using 'for' loops to iterate over lists

## :material-list-box-outline: Review and Discussion
- Review [homework assignments](https://github.com/iao2122/hack-5-python)
- Link to [Lecture 5 slides](../../lectures/5.0/): Python variables, lists, and for loops

## :material-human-male-board-poll: In class exercises
- Create an account on [genepy.org](https://genepy.org/)
- Work through the first 9 exercises exercises (from 'Hello World' to 'Import')

## :material-list-box-outline: Assignments
