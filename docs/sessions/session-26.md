## Icebreaker question

- Do you practice any superstitions (everyday magic) or if not are there any that you think are especially interesting?
    - Touching wood, triscadecaphobia, fortune telling, spilling salt, not stepping on cracks, tapping pipette tip 3 times, wouldn't walk under a ladder

## :material-book-variant: Learning objectives
In this session we will learn about geospatial data analysis with python. By 
the end of this session you will be more familiar with the following topics:

- Raster and Vector data formats
- Coordinate reference systems
- Geospatial analysis with `geopandas`

## :material-human-male-board-poll: In class exercises
- [Intro to Geospatial Analysis Tutorial](../../tutorials/26.0-intro-gis) 

## :material-list-box-outline: Assignments
- Assignment is to keep working on your project, and to prepare for the 
[project presentation](../../pages/presentations)

## :material-human-male-board-poll: Further readings and geospatial resources
- Read the Datacarpentries [Introduction to Geospatial Concepts](https://datacarpentry.github.io/organization-geospatial/)
- [https://pangeo.io/](https://pangeo.io/) <- Lots of links to new/interesting geospatial libraries
- [Geospatial Data Analysis with Python](https://uwgda-jupyterbook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro.html) <- Course work from a recent geospatial class at UW
- [https://pythongis.org/](https://pythongis.org/) <- Introduction to Python for Geographic Data Analysis coursework
