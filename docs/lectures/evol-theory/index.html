              Darwin wrote extensively, and often biographically, about the process by which
              he discovered the theory of evolution. Great scientific breakthroughs do not 
              occur in isolation, but rather emerge as a product of the work and ideas 
              of entire communities. <i>Alfred Russel Wallace demonstrates this point.</i>
              <br><br>

              Thus, while Darwin should be lauded for his great accomplishments, it is good practice to
              avoid "hero worship" of the individuals credited with great historical discoveries, 
              as this can minimize the work of others, as well as set unattainable expectations for
              these individuals.

Lamarck's theory was wrong, however, in proposing how changes among organisms evolve through time. He proposed a process by which acquired characteristics of individuals are inherited from one generation to the next, leading to population change. This is often demonstrated by a giraffe stretching its neck over its lifetime to reach foliage, leading to longer necks passed on to their offspring. This theory of "inheritance of acquired characteristics" is known to false, but nevertheless put forward a testable hypothesis.

            By the 1930's a consensus had developed that adaptive evolution is caused by natural selection 
            acting on particulate (Mendelian) variation. This was spurred by the re-discovery of Mendel's laws of
            heredity, and the development of probability theory, which together allowed for mathematical approaches
            to model the evolution of gene frequencies in populations, led by Wright, Fisher, and Haldane.

              Evolutionary theories of culture often postulate a directionality of evolution, 
              such as a transition from "barbarism" to "technological enlightenment". Cultural
              and racial bias are built-in to these theories, and they have been discredited as
              simplistic, racist, and non-evolutionary since the early 20th century.
              <br><br>
              This was a major topic of academic and political debate in the 1920s, heavily 
              criticized by the Columbia anthropologist Franz Boas, who pushed against racism
              and argued for cultural relativism. He supported Darwinian evolution by critiquing
              tranformative theories of evolution.

              More recent theories, greatly advanced in the "Sociobiology" thesis proposed by 
              E.O Wilson in the 1970s, are variational in nature, proposing that culture is an
              outcome of genetic adaptations in populations. This led to an explosion of 
              related fields like "evolutionary psychology" in the following decades. Examples 
              include statements such as "behavior X is an adaptation because it likely provided
              an evolutionary advantage to our ancestors"

              Such ideas have been proposed to explain religion, warfare, and patriarchical power systems
              -- often without any associated evidence. They are critized for arguing that if something 
              has a (proposed) evolutionary explanation that it is therefore "natural", rather than viewing 
              it from a social justice perspective as something to overcome

            Eugenics is a set of beliefs and practices that aim to improve the genetic quality of a
            human population. Historically, eugenicists have attempted to alter human gene pools by 
            excluding people and groups judged to be inferior or promoting those judged to be superior
            (Wikipedia).

Nearly every evolutionary biologist of the modern synthesis era was involved in debates on the topic.

            The practice of forced or coerced sterilizations as a government 
            sanctioned method of affecting the frequency of traits in a population
            has been practiced for decades.
            <br>
            <br>
            One of the most famous US supreme court cases, Buck v Bell (1927), ruled
            that the state of Virginia could sterilize women for eugenic purposes, 
            leading to more than 70,000 sterilizations.

            Forced sterilization programs continue to this day, though not under 
            the guise/term of eugenics</a>. For example, investigative reporting
            recently revealed that 
            <a href="https://www.revealnews.org/article/female-prison-inmates-sterilized-illegally-california-audit-confirms/">
            nearly 150 Latinx and African-American women were sterilised 
            between 2006 and 2010 in the California prison system.</a>
            These practices are a continuation of history that was insufficiently 
            taught and retold. What is our responsibility as educators
            in evolution?

            Traditional categories of race are not supported by scientific 
            evidence, but, humans do share different degrees of ancestry with one 
            another in ways that can be measured. How can we study and 
            use human ancestry ethically and equitably?

            e.g., quantifying Native American ancestry as a test for membership

            e.g., personalized medicine promises more equitable health care by
            taking into account ancestry. Is racial categorization a lazy solution? 
            Or a tailored solution? Can it be tailored to everyone?
            e.g., genome editing can be used to reduce genetic disease and

            of which is a classic eugenic trope: that more highly 
            educated people reproduce at lower rates causing the population to 
            "degenerates" over time as the descendants of the less educated 
            increase in the population. Fisher wrote on this
            exact scenario in 1930, arguing for government programs to support the 
            upper class to aid in their fertility.
