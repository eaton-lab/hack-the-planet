### Final Project Submission

Your final project submission is due on **4/21/2022** at 1pm EST. We will
begin grading projects based on commits made by this time, but you are of 
course welcome to continue working on your projects for as long as you would
like after class. 


The final project is worth 20% of your total grade. Projects will
be graded on the following criteria:


- Commit history/effort (40%)
- Python Code (15%)
- Minimal working example (15%)
- GitHub repository organization (10%)
- README.md install and demo instructions or other docs (10%)
- Paired programming commits or comments (10%)


### Commit history
By the project submission date you will have worked on your project for over
six weeks. 


have been 9 weeks since we started 
planning projects, and about 6 weeks 

You should have been making commits to your repo over the course of nearly 
two months. Understandably, some will have started faster than others based
on prior experience. If you feel you might have made few commits early on, 
you still have two more weeks to work on your project and make additional 
commits.
