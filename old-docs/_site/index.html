<p>Welcome to the landing page for EEEB G4050, Programming and Data 
Science for Biologists. This site will serve as a resource for the class, 
with links to the syllabus, tutorials, videos, readings, and assignments. 
You can access most of these categories from the navbar at the top, 
including a link to Canvas, which we will use only for grades and zoom links.</p>

<h4 id="course-design">Course design</h4>
<p>As the name suggests, this class is designed to focus on 
<em>programming</em> and <em>data science skills</em>. In this way it may be 
quite different from other classes you have taken that introduced
programming languages for domain-specific applications, such as 
statistics or bioinformatics. Here we will focus more generally on 
learning skills that are useful for any type of data science.
This includes an improved understanding of your operating system, of 
where software resides, of how it is designed, of how programmers write
software, and of the community and resources that are available to you
to learn programming and data science skills on your own. 
By learning best practices for designing software tools you will 
learn that <em>a lot</em> of scientific software is not actually very 
well written or designed. By learning a framework for writing good
software you will find that you can contribute greatly to the 
community of biologists by developing simple and efficient software tools.</p>

<h4 id="inspiration">Inspiration</h4>
<p>The name and design of this site (hack-the-planet) is inspired by the 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackers_(film)">1995 movie <em>Hackers</em></a> 
(I think you can currently find it streaming). 
Although you will not learn to “hack” in the strict sense
in this class, we will follow a general ethos of the film in the
sense of <i>hacking</i> to solve a complex problem by coming up with 
creative solutions, and also in the sense of a <i>community of 
hackers</i> working together to solve problems.</p>

<p>Although you can learn a lot of coding skills through tutorials, 
much of programming comes from learning efficient routines, practices, 
and even muscle memory, all of which comes through practice. 
When you get stuck, try, try, and try again to come up with solutions.
This mental work of thinking about alternative ways to achieve a goal
requires practice. In addition, you can learn by example. Use google. See
how others have solved this type of problem. Use ChatGPT, see how AI
solves different types of problems.
Treat this course like a hackathon, chat with your colleagues,
discuss and work on assignments together, and brainstorm project 
ideas. It should be fun. Drop in and say ‘hello world’ to the course 
<a href="https://gitter.im/hack-the-planet-course/community">chatroom</a>, 
and ask any coding questions you might have.</p>

<p>Finally, our theme of “hack the planet”, borrowed from Hackers, 
relates well to a focus of many students in this class, which is 
an interest in biology and the environment. 
We will learn about finding, parsing, and analyzing large biological 
data sets, such as those used in genomics or biodiversity research.
And we will learn best practices for working with such data. 
Keep this theme in mind as you work through the course, thinking 
of the type of data you want to analyze, and how you could develop
a useful new tool around this type of data.</p>

<h4 id="learning-objectives">Learning objectives</h4>
<ul>
  <li>You will learn to code on <em>your</em> computer (mac, windows, linux, etc.)</li>
  <li>You will learn to install, remove, and update scientific software.</li>
  <li>You will learn to use software development tools (text editors, linting, testing).</li>
  <li>You will learn to plan and design a software tool to achieve some goal.</li>
  <li>You will learn to develop, document, and publish a software program.</li>
</ul>
